>> BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR libmikmod FOR MAC OS X
------------------------------------------------

You can always use the UNIX commandline tools
instead of the IDE projects in this directory.

Go to the top level and follow the INSTALL there...
(Hint: "./configure && make && sudo make install")

In that case your files will end up under /usr/local.
The IDE stuff will end up under a "build" directory.



Mac OS X Public Beta or 10.0
----------------------------

These are buggy pre-releases and should not be used.
Suggest you look below for the real system versions?


Mac OS X 10.1 "Puma"
-------------

1) Go to the Apple store. http://store.apple.com

2) Purchase a new version of Mac OS X. (for $129)
   It comes with a newer version Developer Tools.


Mac OS X 10.2 "Jaguar"
-------------

1) You should be using the December 2002 Dev Tools.

2) Open "libmikmod.pbproj" with Project Builder.


Mac OS X 10.3 "Panther"
-------------

1) You should be using Xcode 1.1 Dev Tools, or up.

2) Open "libmikmod.xcode" with the Xcode app.



Build products
--------------

The projects will build a static library with header:
- mikmod.h
- libmikmod.a
And they will also build a dynamic framework bundle:
- mikmod.framework

These build products are normally found in the "build"
folder, unless you have changed your IDE settings...

Unless you are building an application to be used from
Mac OS 9 too (which these tools won't do anyway), the
CoreAudio driver is recommended - since it's better...
(the library/framework does not build the Carbon driver)

If you *want* to build the Carbon driver, then #define
DRV_MAC in the config.h and add Carbon framework below.



Using the library
----------------

To use the library, either copy "mikmod.framework"
bundle to somewhere in your framework search path,
(such as ~/Library/Frameworks or /Library/Frameworks)

Source code:	#include <mikmod/mikmod.h>

Linker flags:	-framework mikmod


Or copy the "mikmod.h" header and "libmikmod.a" library
to somewhere in the include and library search paths.
(such as /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib)

Source code:	#include "mikmod.h"

Linker flags:	-lmikmod -framework CoreAudio


The HTML documentation is found in the "docs" folder,
located in the top level of the libmikmod distribution.



Enjoy!
